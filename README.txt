This repository serves as Anusha Pant and Isha Singh's final project submission for the CS-2362 course at Ashoka University.

We have implemented an authentication application of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm,
as proposed in "Shamir's Secret Sharing for Authentication without Reconstructing Password" by Gupta, Rahman,Dasgupta and Poudyal.

We have built a client-server system which demonstrates the authentication protocol described in the paper mentioned above.
To see the full report and analysis of the project, navigate to _____.
In order to see the system running, it is required to run both, the server.py and the client.py files.

Steps:
1. Download this repository in the location of your choice.
2. Open one tab of the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the downloaded repository.
3. Run the server file by using the following command: python3 server.py.
4. In other tab of the terminal/command prompt, navigate to the downloaded repository again.
5. Run the client file by using the following command: python3 client.py.
6. Follow the registration and sign-in steps as prompted in the terminal to see the results of the implemented authentication protocol!
